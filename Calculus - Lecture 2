Calculus 

Change & Aggregation
---------------------

Derivatives : 
1. Capture Change Change X -> Change Y
2 . Y = f(x) thefore Change X -> Change Y
3. Y = x^2
4. dy / dx = Change in Y becos of change in x
5. This is also called as f' ( F Dash)
6. f' = dy / dx = (2) (x^2-1) = 2x
7. Derivative of a constant is 0 becos 
   it does not change
8. Regression is 0 Syllabus
9. Derivative is also called Differentiator

Economics is about to capture Change

1. Marginal instead of Average
2. On averages you cannot make policy
3. Eg. Per Capita income - 72000 / year 
4. Marginal Analyst - Someone who can explain Change
5 Unitary - Change where %change in x --> %Change in Y
6. In postive slopes the steeper you are the more elastic you are
7. In Negative Slopes the flatter you are the less responsive you are 
8. Inflexion Point 
9. Inflexion - Point at which the rate of change changes and 
   the direction remains the same.
10. F is called maxima
11. Peak is the point after which there is a fall.
12. For maxima f' = 0 , f'' < 0
13. 

Homework
---------------------------------------------------------
What are the stratergies in the shoe world
that you would suggest to a company where you 
get Ability and Willingness more favourable /elastic ?

Give illustrations . - Tell me how that strategy will 
dynamically unfold itself , for a company . Explain the theory
not examples- where we list only stuff
