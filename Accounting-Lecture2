  > Probablistic Model
        Assessement of the probability
  > Price / Demand Model 
        Price go down , demand go up
        What to order 
        How much to order 
        When to order

- Deterministic
    > EOQ - Economic Order Quantity ( Only Theory / Practically Useless)
        - Fixed Consumption Rate
        - No Volume Discount on Purchase
        - Ordering Cost Independent of Quantity
        - Balance Ordering Cost vs Cost of Inventory Storage
        - Infinite Shelf Life

        - Limitations 
            - Assumptions of EOQ  
                - Uniform Consumption Rate  
                - Completely Predictable Supply Lead Time
                - Precise Determination of Ordering Cost, 
                    Inventory Carrying Cost & Backorder cost.
                - No Minimum Order Qty / Multiples of ordering Lots 
                - Infinite Shelf Life
            - These assumptions have made EOQ a theoretical model.

    > Order Quantity Dependent Purchase Cost ( Price Breaks)

- Excel Add on - Solver

- Multi Period Models 

- Fixed Period Review P System 
    - Review Period 
        - Higher the period , higher the stocks
        - Lower the period , more frequent ordering
        - Should be more than supply lead time.
    - Safety Stock
-       - To take care of variations in demand  
        - Max Possible Demand during review period  
          less average demand during review period.
        - A function of % confidence or Service Level.
